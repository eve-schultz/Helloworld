<h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
  To me HTML is the basic building block of every website, media platform, 
  and just in all the building block for the internet. HTML goes ahead to 
   make all of those websites and apps eye appealing, consisting and holding 
   what each site is made up of. 
   It also interprets code so that it is easier to read.

  By taking this class I am hoping to gain a better understanding and 
  knowledge for computer software. In all honesty I am not very tech
  savvy and this looked like an intriguing course to help expand my horizons
  of technology. I also would like to create my own online business and hope
  to learn how to market my products and create an appealing website for the
  business.
